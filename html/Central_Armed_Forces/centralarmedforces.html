        <h3 id="crpf">Central Reserve Police Force</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF)</strong> is India's
          largest Central Armed Police Force . It functions under the authority
          of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) of the Government of India. The
          CRPF's primary role lies in assisting the State/Union Territories in
          police operations to maintain law and order and counter insurgency. It
          came into existence as the Crown Representative's Police on 27 July
          1939. After Indian Independence, it became the Central Reserve Police
          Force on enactment of the CRPF Act on 28 December 1949.<br /><br />

          Besides law and order and counter-insurgency duties, the CRPF has
          played an increasingly large role in India's general elections. This
          is especially true for the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, Bihar
          and in the North East, with the presence of unrest and often violent
          conflict. During the Parliamentary elections of September 1999, the
          CRPF played a major role in the security arrangements. Of late, CRPF
          contingents are also being deployed in UN missions.<br /><br />

          With 246 battalions and various other establishments, the CRPF is
          considered India's largest paramilitary force and has a sanctioned
          strength of more than 300,000 personnel as of 2019.

          primary border patrol organization for its border with China's Tibet
          Autonomous Region. It is one of the five Central Armed Police Forces

          regulation" of the ITBP "for ensuring the security of the borders of
          India and for matters connected therewith".[3][4] The first head of
          the ITBP, designated Inspector General, was Balbir Singh, a police
          officer previously belonging to the Intelligence Bureau. The ITBP,
          which started with 4 battalions, has, since restructuring in 1978,
          undergone expansion to a force of 60 Battalions with 15 Sectors and 05

          trained in the Civil Medical Camp, disaster management, and nuclear,
          biological and chemical disasters. ITBP personnel have been deployed
          abroad in UN peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo,
          Sierra Leone, Haiti, Western Sahara, Sudan, Afghanistan, and
          elsewhere. Two battalions of ITBP are deputed to National Disaster
          Response Force.

        <p>
          The <strong>National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)</strong> is an
          Indian specialized force constituted "for the purpose of special
          response to a threatening disaster situation or disaster" under the
          Disaster Management Act, 2005. The "Apex Body for Disaster Management"
          in India is the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). The
          Chairman of the NDMA is the Prime Minister. <br /><br />

          The responsibility of managing disasters in India is that of the State
          Government. The ‘Nodal Ministry’ in the central government for
          management of natural disasters is the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).
          <br /><br />

          When 'calamities of severe nature' occur, the Central Government is
          responsible for providing aid and assistance to the affected state,
          including deploying, at the State's request, of Armed Forces, Central
          Paramilitary Forces, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and such
          communication, air and other assets, as are available and needed.
          <br /><br />

          National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) is under the National Disaster
          Management Authority. The head of the NDRF is designated as Director
          General. The Director Generals of NDRF are IPS officers on deputation
          from Indian police organizations. Director General is a three-star
          officer. <br /><br />

          The NDRF is a top-heavy organization which in addition to the Director
          General has several Inspector Generals (IG) and Deputy IGs, who are
          flag officers and wear badges of rank.

        <p>
          The <strong>Defence Security Corps (DSC)</strong>, is a corps of the
          Indian Army responsible for providing security cover to the defence
          installations of the three services (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other
          sensitive installations. The DSC troops are sanctioned and attached to
          various bases/installations to ensure protection against sabotage and
          pilferage. It is the sixth largest corps of the Army. <br /><br />

          Currently, the major sanction of DSC troops is for the Army and Air
          force installations. The Naval units and other user agencies have a
          sizeable deployment of this force.[1] DSC troops also provide security
          to some of the Indian Ordnance Factories, India's nuclear
          laboratories, and Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)
          establishments.

        <h3 id="spg">Special Protection Group</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Special Protection Group (SPG)</strong> is an Indian
          paramilitary force whose sole objective is providing proximate
          security to the Prime Minister of India. It was formed in 1988 by an
          Act of the Parliament of India. The SPG provides executive protection
          to the Prime Minister both in India and on international trips
          anywhere in the world, as well as to the Prime Minister's immediate
          family members residing with them at their official residence. Family
          members, however, may decline security. <br /><br />

          Previously, the SPG's mandate included protecting the Prime Minister's
          "parents, wife and children" resident anywhere in India, as well as
          former Prime Ministers' dependents for five years after leaving
          office. However, the Special Protection Group (Amendment) Act, 2019
          reduced such mandate Currently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the
          only SPG protectee.

        <h3 id="sapf">State Armed Police Forces</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>State Armed Police Forces</strong> of India are the police
          units established for dealing with serious law and order situations
          requiring a higher level of armed expertise than normal. The State
          Armed Police Forces exist in addition to the ordinary police services
          of the various states. <br /><br />

          The various States have different titles for their armed police units.
          In addition to the general term "Armed Police", other titles in
          different states include Special Armed Police, Armed Constabulary,
          Provincial Armed Constabulary and State Military Police. Although the
          titles are different, their organisation, weapons, equipment and tasks
          are broadly the same. The central government of India now refers to
          these forces nationwide as the State Armed Police Forces and
          discourages use of the term "paramilitary". However, this terminology
          does not necessarily coincide with the existing terminology of the
          states of India; For example, the state of Bihar calls its state armed
          police force "Military Police", which clashes with central government
          definitions of "military" and "paramilitary". It is not yet clear
          whether such discrepancies will be resolved. <br /><br />

          The State Armed Police act as a mobile armed reserve activated only on
          the orders from the Additional Commissioner of Police or above. They
          are not usually in contact with the public except during public
          events, civil unrest, and natural disasters. They maintain key guard
          posts and participate in antiterrorist operations. Depending on the
          type of assignment, they may be or may not be carrying firearms.
          <br /><br />

          Within states, each police district may maintain its own teams of
          policemen with higher firearms competence. Such teams, known as
          "district armed police", are for purely local use leaded by CAPFs
          officer on deputation and are not part of the State Armed Police
          Forces.

        <h3 id="hg">Home Guard (India)</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Indian Home Guard</strong> is a volunteer tasked as an
          auxiliary to the Indian police. The Home Guards Organisation was
          reorganised in India in 1966 after the Sino-Indian War with the
          People's Republic of China, though it existed in smaller units
          individually in some places. Home Guards are recruited from various
          cross sections of the civil society such as professionals, college
          students, agricultural and industrial workers (but only to the
          government) etc who give their spare time for betterment of the
          community. All citizens of India, in the age group of 18–50, are
          eligible. Normal tenure of membership in Home Guards is three to five
          years.
