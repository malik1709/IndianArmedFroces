        <h2>ORGANISATION STRUCTURE</h2>
        <p>
          The President of India is the Supreme Commander of all Indian armed
          forces and by virtue of that fact is the national Commander-in-chief
          of the Air Force. Chief of the Air Staff with the rank of Air Chief
          Marshal is the Commander of the Indian Air Force. He is assisted by
          six officers, all with the rank of Air Marshal:
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <ol class="list">
          <li>Vice Chief of the Air Staff</li>
          <li>Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</li>
          <li>Air Officer in Charge of Administration</li>
          <li>Air Officer in Charge of Personnel</li>
          <li>Air Officer in Charge of Maintenance</li>
          <li>Director General of Inspection and Flight Safety</li>
        </ol>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          In January 2002, the government conferred the rank of Marshal of the
          Air Force on Arjan Singh making him the first and only Five-star
          officer with the Indian Air Force and ceremonial chief of the air
          force. <br /><br /><br />
          <strong>Formation of Indian Air Force Commands</strong> <br /><br />
          The Indian Air Force is divided into five operational and two
          functional commands. Each Command is headed by an Air Officer
          Commanding-in-Chief with the rank of Air Marshal. The purpose of an
          operational command is to conduct military operations using aircraft
          within its area of responsibility, whereas the responsibility of
          functional commands is to maintain combat readiness. Aside from the
          Training Command at Bangalore, the center for primary flight training
          is located at the Air Force Academy in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh,
          followed by operational training at various other schools. Advanced
          officer training for command positions is also conducted at the
          Defence Services Staff College; specialized advanced flight training
          schools are located at Bidar, Karnataka, and Hakimpet, Andhra Pradesh
          (also the location for helicopter training). Technical schools are
          found at a number of other locations. Here is a list of Commands:

          <strong>Operational Commands</strong> <br /><br />
        </p>
        <ol class="list">
          <li>
            Central Air Command (CAC), headquartered at Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh
          </li>
          <li>
            Eastern Air Command (EAC), headquartered at Shillong, Meghalaya
          </li>
          <li>
            Southern Air Command (SAC), headquartered at Thiruvananthapuram,
            Kerala
          </li>
          <li>
            South Western Air Command (SWAC), headquartered at Gandhinagar,
            Gujarat
          </li>
          <li>
            Western Air Command (WAC), headquartered at Subroto Park, New Delhi
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br /><br />
        <p><strong>Functional Commands</strong><br /><br /></p>
        <ol class="list">
          <li>Training Command (TC), headquartered at Bangalore, Karnataka</li>
          <li>
            Maintenance Command (MC), headquartered at Nagpur, Maharashtra
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br /><br /><br />
        <p>
          <strong>Wings</strong> <br /><br />
          A Wing is a formation intermediate between a Command and a Squadron.
          It generally consists of two or three IAF Squadrons and Helicopter
          Units, along with Forward Base Support Units (FBSU). FBSUs do not have
          or host any Squadrons or Helicopter units but act as transit airbases
          for routine operations. In times of war, they can become fully fledged
          air bases playing host to various Squadrons. In all, about 47 Wings
          and 19 FBSUs make up the IAF. Wings are typically commanded by a Group
          Captain.
          <br /><br /><br />
          <strong>Squadrons</strong> <br /><br />
          Squadrons are the field units and formations attached to static
          locations. Thus, a Flying Squadron is a sub-unit of an air force
          station which carries out the primary task of the IAF. All fighter
          squadrons are headed by a Commanding Officer with the rank of Wing
          Commander. Some Transport squadrons and Helicopter Units are headed by
          a Commanding Officer with the rank of Group Captain.
          <br /><br /><br />
          <strong>Flights</strong><br /><br />
          Flights are sub-divisions of Squadrons, commanded by a Squadron
          Leader. Within this formation structure, IAF has several service
          branches for day-to-day operations. They are: <br /><br />
