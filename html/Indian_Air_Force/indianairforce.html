        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          The Indian Air Force was officially established on 8 October 1932. Its
          first ac flight came into being on 01 Apr 1933. It possessed a
          strength of six RAF-trained officers and 19 Havai Sepoys (literally,
          air soldiers). The aircraft inventory comprised of four Westland
          Wapiti IIA army co-operation biplanes at Drigh Road as the "A" Flight
          nucleus of the planned No.1 (Army Co- operation) Squadron.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Cutting Its Teeth</h3>
        <p>
          Four-and-a-half years later, "A" Flight was in action for the first
          time from Miranshah, in North Waziristan, to support Indian Army
          operations against insurgent Bhittani tribesmen. Meanwhile, in April
          1936, a "B" Flight had also been formed on the vintage Wapiti. But, it
          was not until June 1938 that a "C" Flight was raised to bring No. 1
          Squadron ostensibly to full strength, and this remained the sole IAF
          formation when World War II began, although personnel strength had by
          now risen to 16 officers and 662 men. <br /><br />
          Problems concerning the defence of India were reassessed in 1939 by
          the Chatfield Committee. It proposed the re-equipment of RAF (Royal
          Air Force) squadrons based in lndia but did not make any suggestions
          for the accelerating the then painfully slow growth of IAF except for
          a scheme to raise five flights on a voluntary basis to assist in the
          defence of the principal ports. An IAF Volunteer Reserve was thus
          authorised, although equipping of the proposed Coastal Defence Flights
          (CDFs) was somewhat inhibited by aircraft availability. Nevertheless,
          five such flights were established with No. 1 at Madras, No. 2 at
          Bombay, No. 3 at Calcutta, No. 4 at Karachi and No. 5 at Cochin. No. 6
          was later formed at Vizagapatanam. Built up around a nucleus of
          regular IAF and RAF personnel, these flights were issued with both
          ex-RAF Wapitis and those relinquished by No. 1 Squadron IAF after its
          conversion to the Hawker Hart. In the event, within a year, the
          squadron was to revert back to the Wapiti because of spares shortages,
          the aged Westland biplanes being supplemented by a flight of Audaxes.
          <br /><br />
          At the end of March 1941, Nos. 1 and 3 CDFs gave up their Wapitis
          which were requisitioned to equip No. 2 Squadron raised at Peshawar in
          the following month, and were instead issued with Armstrong Whitworth
          Atalanta transports, used to patrol the Sunderbans delta area south of
          Calcutta. No. 2 CDF had meanwhile received requisitioned D.H. 89
          Dragon Rapides for convoy and coastal patrol, while No. 5 CDF took on
          strength a single D.H. 86 which it used to patrol the west of Cape
          Camorin and the Malabar Coast. <br /><br />
          Meanwhile the creation of a training structure in India became
          imperative and RAF flying instructors were assigned to flying clubs to
          instruct IAF Volunteer Reserve cadets on Tiger Moths.364 pupils were
          to receive elementary flying training at seven clubs in British India
          and two in various princely States by the end of 1941. Some
          comparative modernity was infused in August 1941, when No. 1 Squadron
          began conversion to the Westland Lysander at Drigh Road, the Unit
          being presented with a full establishment of 12 Lysanders at Peshawar
          by the Bombay War Gifts Fund in the following November. No. 2 Squadron
          had converted from the Wapiti to the Audax in September 1941 and, on 1
          October No. 3 Squadron, similarly Audax-equipped, was raised at
          Peshawar. <br /><br />
          The IAF VR was now inducted into the regular IAF, the individual
          flights initially retaining their coastal defence status, but with
          Japan's entry into the war in December, No. 4 Flight, with four
          Wapitis and two Audaxes, was despatched to Burma to operate from
          Moulmein. Unfortunately, four of the flight's six aircraft were
          promptly lost to Japanese bombing and, late in January 1942, No. 4
          Flight gave place in Moulmein to No. 3 Flight which had meanwhile
          re-equipped with four ex-RAF Blenheim ls. For a month, these Blenheims
          were to provide almost the sole air cover for ships arriving at
          Rangoon harbour.

          <p>
            On 1 February, No.1 Squadron arrived in Burma with its Lysanders,
            flying tactical recce missions from Toungoo before transferring to
            Mingaladon with a flight deployed at Lashio. I A F personnel were
            soon hanging pairs of 250-lb. bombs on each of their Lysanders and
            with these, flew low-level unescorted missions against the principal
            Japanese air bases at Mae-Haungsaun, Cheingmai and Chiangrai in
            Thailand. However, the Japanese advance was relentless and with the
            final evacuation of Burma, No.1 Squadron personnel were flown to
            India, where at Risalpur in June 1942, the unit began conversion to
            the Hurricane IIB fighter. No.2 Squadron had also equipped with
            Lysanders by the end of 1941, being confined to anti-invasion
            exercises until, in September 1942, it emulated the IAF's premier
            unit by converting to Hurricanes. The third IAF unit to operate the
            Lysander was No.4 Squadron, formed with four aircraft on 16 February
            1942. This squadron was to continue to operate the Westland aircraft
            until it, too was re-equipped with the Hurricane in June 1943. Six
            months earlier, No.6 Squadron was raised with personnel from Nos 1
            and 2 flights, being Hurricane-equipped from the outset. Between
            March and December 1942, 10 aircrew schools were opened in India,
            and the first Harvard Is and IIs were delivered to No. 1 Flying
            Training School at Ambala, this school having been established to
            provide basic and advanced training for IAF pilots over a
            four-and-half month course. By the end of that year, however,or a
            decade after the IAF's creation and three years into World War II,
            the Service could muster just five squadrons. The coastal defence
            flights had now been disbanded and most personnel of Nos.3 and 6
            Flights were combined with regular IAF personnel to form No. 7
            Squadron which was equipped with the U:S. - built Vengeance 1 dive
            bomber in mid-February 1943. No. 8 Squadron was raised meanwhile, on
            1 December 1942, absorbing the remaining coastal defence flight
            personnel, and also issued with the Vengeance, to achieve
            operational status on 25June 1943. <br /><br />
            LysanderThe Vengeance suffered numerous defects and teething
            troubles, necessitating temporary withdrawal from the two IAF
            squadrons, but the problems were eventually mitigated if not
            eradicated, and No. 8 Sqn flew its first operational Vengeance
            sorties against Japanese targets from Double Moorings, Chittagong,
            on 15 December 1943, No. 7 Squadron, which had flown its Vengeances
            on some missions against dissident tribesmen in North Waziristan,
            started operations in the Arakan from an airstrip at Uderbund, near
            Kumbigram, where it arrived on 12 March 1944, the two squadrons
            converting to Vengeance IIIs during the course of operations and
            both flying with considerable distinction.No. 7 Squadron discarded
            its dive bombers in favour of Hurricane IIs for the
            tactical-reconnaissance role in November 1944, No. 8 Squadron
            becoming the first to convert onto the Spitfire VIII during the
            previous month and commencing operations on 3 January 1945 in the
            Kangaw area.
            <br /><br />
            Both Nos 9 and 10 Squadrons were raised on Hurricanes in the early
            months of 1944, and thus, by the end of the year, the operational
            element of the IAF had risen to nine squadrons, with Nos.
            1,2,3,4,6,7,9 and 10 on Hurricanes and No.8 on Spitfires. Five of
            the Hurricane-equipped squadrons played a major role in the Arakan
            offensive which began in December 1944, disrupting the enemy's lines
            of communication and constantly harrying the Japanese forces until
            victory was achieved with the re-occupation of Rangoon on 3 May
            1945. In that month, No. 4 Squadron became the second IAF Spitfire
            unit when it re-equipped with the Mk VIII version of this fighter,
            and No. 9 followed suit to complete conversion byJuly, by which time
            No. 10 had begun conversion, and the Hurricane, backbone of the IAF
            combat element for much of the war, was rapidly phased out.
            <br /><br />
            Distinguished flying crossesHurricanDuring the war years, the steady
            expansion of the IAF had placed all emphasis on army co-operation
            and tactical reconnaissance; it had continued to fly ageing
            equipment such as the Hurricane when such aircraft as the
            Thunderbolt and Mosquito were being inducted in large numbers by
            other Allied forces in the theatre and it had, in consequence,
            suffered a sense of equipment inferiority. Nevertheless, assigned
            the least glamorous of tasks and flying obsolescent equipment, the
            Service established traditions of courage and efficiency second to
            none; its personnel had been awarded 22 Distinguished Flying Crosses
            and a host of other decorations, and in recognition of its
            achievements, the Service had been honoured by bestowal of the
            prefix "Royal" on its title in March 1945.

          </summary>
          <p>
            The stimulus provided by the Second World War had raised RIAF
            personnel strength to 28,500 including some 1,600 officers, by the
            time hostilities terminated. In August 1945, No. 4 Squadron was
            designated a component unit of the British Commonwealth Occupation
            Forces in Japan, exchanging its Spitfire Vllls for Mk XlVs in
            October and arriving in Japan aboard HMS vengence on 23 April 1946.
            Meanwhile, from late 1945, theremaining Hurricane-equipped RIAF
            fighter squadrons converted to the Spitfire at Kohat, Samungli and
            Risalpur and by mid-1946 the entire RIAF fighter force was
            Spitfire-equipped. The year 1946 also saw the establishment of the
            first RIAF transport unit, No.12 Squadron which had first been
            raised on Spitfires at Kohat in December 1945 and received C-47
            Dakotas in Panagarh in late 1946. A decision had also been taken to
            re-equip the fighter squadrons with the Tempest II, and
            implementation of this decision began during the autumn of 1946, No.
            3 Squadron at Kolar becoming the first to re-equip, followed by
            No.10 Squadron later in 1946. <br /><br />
            Personnel strength had meanwhile been virtually halved to some
            14,000 officers and men in the post-war rundown, but the British
            authorities had made their own assessment of India's post-war
            defence needs. As of October 1946, they envisaged expansion of the
            existing ten RIAF squadrons into a balanced force of twenty fighter,
            bomber and transport squadrons. Owing to the rapidly changing
            political situation, however, definitive decisions concerning Indian
            defence were, in the event, to be left to the emerging Government of
            Independent India. No. 4 Squadron converted to the Tempest 11 upon
            its return to India from Japan and Nos.7 and 8 Squadrons also
            relinquished their Spitfires for the more efficacious Tempest
            fighter during the summer of 1947. Nos. 1 and 9 Squadrons, too,
            received Tempest lls at this time, but on 15 August 1947, and with
            the division of both India and its armed forces, these units stood
            down and their equipment was transferred to the newly created Royal
            Pakistan Air Force. Thus, the principal components of the RIAF at
            partition were Nos. 3,4,7,8 and 10 Squadrons with Tempest us, No. 2
            Squadron with Spitfires and No. 12 Squadron with C-47s, plus No. 1
            Air Observation Flight, the establishment of which with AOP Auster
            4s, 5s, and 6s, coincided with independence. No. 6 Squadron, which
            had been in process of converting from Spitfires to C-47s at Drigh
            Road, had been stood down and its transports transferred to
            Pakistan. <br /><br />
            SpitfireSuper spit fireThe RIAF had lost many permanent bases and
            other establishments as a result of the division of the country, but
            was to have virtually no breathing space in which to recover from
            the surgery that had accompanied partition before the Service was to
            find itself once more firing its guns in earnest. On 27 October
            1947, No.12 Sqn was to initiate the remarkable feat of air-lifting
            the Ist Sikhs from Palam onto the rough and dusty Srinagar airstrip
            without planning or reconnaissance as the initial Indian response to
            the sizeable insurgent forces that were pouring across the border
            into Jammu and Kashmir. On 30 October, the first Spitfires from the
            Advanced Flying School at Ambala reached Srinagar and were soon
            engaged in strafing the raiders beyond Pattan. Within a week, the
            Tempests of No. 7 Squadron were playing a decisive role in the
            battle of Shelatang which halted the forward momentum of the
            insurgents. <br /><br />
            The fighting was to continue for 15 months, with heavy RIAF
            involvement throughout, a ceasefire eventually coming into force on
            1 January 1949, but despite being continuously on an operational
            footing throughout this period, the reorganisation and modernisation
            of the Service continued unabated. The Combined Services
            Headquarters had meanwhile been separated for command purposes and
            Air Headquarters established in New Delhi. This included the
            Operational and Training Commands, No. 1 Operational Group having
            been formed to supervise all RIAF units and their support elements
            engaged in the campaign in Jammu and Kashmir.

            1948. The same year witnessed various equipment changes, one of
            which was to have a profound effect on the composition of the RIAF.
            The Service, wishing to establish a heavy bombing element,
            contracted with HAL to "re-construct" a force of B-24 Liberators
            from the mouldering remains of nearly 100 ex USAF bombers of this
            type at the immense Care and Maintenance Unit Depot at Kanpur.

            bomber of No.5 Squadron ("Tuskers") over the Deccan plateau in the
            early 1950s. Despite the scepticism on the part of the US and
            British advisers concerning the feasibility of the scheme, the first
            half-dozen HAL-reconditioned B-24s were ready by November 1948 and,
            on the 17th of that month, No. 5 Squadron was formed with these
            heavy bombers. Later, in early 1950, No. 6 Squadron was to re-form
            at Poona also with B-24s, while No.16 Squadron was to be established
            to provide back-up training on thetype. To supplement the Tiger
            Moths, Prentice basic trainers were delivered to the RIAF during the
            course of 1948, eventually to see service at Jodhpur, Tambaram and
            Ambala, but truly epoch making in so far as the Service was
            concerned, was the arrival in India on 4 November 1948 of three
            Vampire F.Mk.3 jet fighters. These were the precursors of more than
            400 Vampires of various types that were procured by the Service over
            the following years. The achievement of operational status on the
            Vampire FBMk.52 by No. 7 Squadron in the following year was to give
            the RIAF the distinction of becoming the first Asian air arm to
            operate jets.

          <p>
            In January 1950, India became a Republic within the British
            Commonwealth and the Indian Air Force dropped its "Royal" prefix. At
            this time, it possessed six fighter squadrons of Spitfires, Vampires
            and Tempests, operating from Kanpur, Poona, Ambala and Palam, one
            B-24 bomber squadron, one C-47 Dakota transport squadron, one AOP
            flight, a communications squadron at Palam and a growing training
            organisation. Training adhered closely to the pattern established by
            the RAF, most instructors having graduated from the CFS in the UK
            and in addition to No.1. Flying Training School at Hyderabad with
            Tiger Moths and Harvards and No. 2 FTS atJodhpur with Prentices and
            Harvards, there were IAF colleges at Begumpet, Coimbatore
            andJodhpur.Licence manufacture of the de Havilland Vampire had been
            initiated by HAL which, after building a batch from imported major
            assemblies, went on to manufacture a further 250. In addition, 60
            Vampire T Mk. 55s were to be built of which 10 were assembled from
            imported kits. Nos.2,3 and 8 Squadrons followed No.7 Squadron on the
            Vampire, but, extraordinarily, 1951 also saw the formation of the
            last piston-engined fighter combat unit when No. 14 Squadron was
            raised on the Spitfire Mk. XVIII. Vampire NF Mk. 54 two-seat night
            fighters were obtained in May 1953 to re-equip No. 10. Sqn at Palam,
            thus endowing night-intercept capability upon the IAF for the first
            time. At this time, relations between India and Pakistan were again
            steadily deteriorating and the IAF, its combat strength virtually
            unchanged since partition in 1947, was scarcely ready for any
            full-scale conflict. Plans were accordingly framed for major
            expansion during the period 1953-57, and the Government began to
            seek non-traditional and alternative sources of combat aircraft
            procurement. <br /><br />
            Selection of the Dassault Ouragan fighter from France at this time
            reflected the decision to initiate diversification of supply
            sources. The first four of over 100 Ouragans, or Toofanis as they
            were to become known in the IAF, reached Palam from France on 24
            October 1953, and this type re-equipped Nos.8, 3 and 4 Squadrons in
            that order. The Toofanis were eventually to be passed on to
            newly-raised units Nos. 29 and 47 Squadrons, with the re-equipment
            in 1957 of Nos. 3 and 8 Squadrons with the Mystere IVA from the same
            Gallic stable.
            <br /><br />
            Re-equipment of the combat units necessarily assumed an overriding
            priority in view of the growth of what were seen as threats to
            India's integrity, but expansion of airlift capability was also
            vital. A second transport squadron, No. 11, had been formed on C-47
            Dakotas in September 1951, and considerable enhancement of the
            Service's logistic support capacity was heralded by procurement of
            26 Fairchild C-119G Packets from the United States which reached
            India by the end of 1954. Rapidly to assume the status of an airlift
            backbone, the C- 119Gs were issued to No. 12 Squadron, which, for
            some years, operated them in concert with the C-47s, the older
            transports eventually passing to a newly-raised unit, No. 43
            Squadron. A second batch of 29 C- 119Gs was obtained in July 1960,
            and the transport fleet was further augmented by another 24 C-119Gs
            in May 1963 under US emergency military aid.
            <br /><br />
            Both the establishment of a Maintenance Command and resurrection of
            the Auxiliary Air Force took place in 1955, two units of the latter
            being formed as Nos. 51 and 52 Squadrons at New Delhi and Bombay. A
            third AAF unit, No. 53 Sqn, was raised at Madras in the following
            year, and four more added over the next two years, Nos. 54
            (Allahabad), 55 (Calcutta), 56 (Bhubaneshwar) and 57 (Chandigarh)
            Squadrons. The AAF squadrons were equipped with the HAL-designed
            HT-2 trainer - officially introduced into service on 10 January 1955
            - and the Harvard, although Vampire FB Mk. 52s were added in 1959.
            <br /><br />
            Expansion and modernisation Particularly significant in IAF was the
            year 1957, which witnessed true beginnings of the major re-equipment
            programme that was to raise the Service fully to world standards.
            Deliveries began of 110 Dassault Mystere IVAs, carrying the service
            into the realms of transonic flight for the first time, and both
            Hawker Hunters and English Electric Canberras began to enter the IAF
            inventory. A new No. 1 Squadron was raised on the Mystere, the
            existing Vampire-equipped No. 1 Squadron being redesignated as No.
            27 Squadron; No. 5 Squadron re-equipped with the Canberra B(l) Mk.
            58, and, at the year's end, No. 7 Squadron began conversion to the
            Hunter FMk.56. It was perhaps appropriate that the year which saw
            commencement of an immense infusion of modern hardware should also
            witness the end of the IAF's piston-engined fighter epoch: No. 14
            Squadron, the last firstline piston-engined fighter unit, flew in
            its Spitfire Mk. XVllls to Halwara in preparation for re-equipment
            with the Vampire. <br /><br />
            The IAF's energies were now taxed heavily with implementation of an
            expansion programme aimed at raising the Service from a 15-squadron
            force to no fewer than 33 squadrons over an extremely short span of
            years: a Herculean task when performed simultaneously with sweeping
            equipment changes. Several new squadrons, such as Nos. 15, 17, 20,
            24, 27 and 45, were raised on Vampire FB Mk. 52s as interim
            equipment; Canberra B(l) Mk. 58s had equipped two additional
            squadrons, Nos. 16 and 35 by 1959, No. 106 Squadron having equipped
            with Canberra PR Mk. 57s and by the end of the 1961, six squadrons
            (Nos.7, 14, 17, 20, 27 and 37) were equipped with the Hunter. Growth
            was not restricted to the combat elements for, in parallel, the
            IAF's transport force was enlarged to six squadrons, three with
            C-47s (Nos. 11, 43 and 49), two with C-119Gs (Nos. 12 and 19) and
            one with DHC-3 Otters (No.41).
            <br /><br />
            CanberraThe early sixties were accompanied by the IAF's induction of
            yet more new aircraft types, the most interesting of these arguably
            being the Folland Gnat lightweight fighter. With its startling
            agility, the Gnat proffered outstanding cost effectiveness and
            during the mid-fifties a licence agreement was concluded for its
            manufacture by HAL following delivery of 23 complete aircraft and 20
            sets of components by the parent company. The first IAF unit, No. 23
            Squadron, converted from the Vampire FB Mk. 52 to the Gnat in March
            1960. No. 2 Squadron re-equipped with the Gnat at Ambala early in
            1962, and No.9 Squadron soon followed suit.

          <summary><h3 id="congo">Canberras in The Congo</h3></summary>
          <p>
            An unusual commitment of the IAF was to support United Nations
            operations on the Congo (now Zaire) in 1961-62. Following an appeal
            by the U.N. for both troops and combat aircraft to restore law and
            order and keep peace, six Canberra B(1) 58s of No.5 Squadron were
            flown from Agra to Central Africa. Operating from Leopoldville and
            Kamina, the Canberras soon destroyed the rebel air force, raided
            Katangan targets and generally provided the U.N. ground forces with
            its only long-range air support force. <br /><br />
            <strong>Soviet transports and helicopters</strong><br /><br />
            Further procurement source diversification had been signified late
            in 1960 when, as a result of the increasing frequency of clashes
            with Chinese forces on the Sino-lndian Himalayan border and the need
            that these revealed for yet further increase in airlift capability,
            together with a requirement for medium helicopters suitable for
            high-altitude operation, orders were placed in the Soviet Union for
            eight Antonov An- 12B and 24 IL-yushin 11- 14 transport aircraft
            plus 10 Mi-4 helicopters. The first An-12B arrived in India on 1
            March 1961, No. 44 Squadron being formed on this type, the 11-14s
            that followed equipping another newly-raised squadron, No. 42. A
            follow-on order for a further eight An-12Bs was placed early in
            1962, the IAF finally beginning to build up a really credible heavy
            airlift capability which was to be immensely enhanced with the
            arrival of a further 25 An-12Bs under a loan agreement signed in
            July 1963, a second squadron, No.25, meanwhile being formed on this
            type.
            <br /><br />
            The Mi-4 helicopter was to have as profound an effect on IAF
            capability as did the An-12B. Prior to the phase-in on this Soviet
            type, the Service had but a handful of ageing Sikorsky S-55s, plus a
            number of small Bell 47Gs, and with the delivery of Mi-4s, major
            expansion of the IAF rotorcraft inventory began. No.109 Helicopter
            Unit was formed with the first Mi-4s and following an order for
            further 16 Mi-4s in early 1962, other helicopter units were formed
            in North-East India, successive orders in 1963-64 and 1966
            eventually bringing the total number of Mi-4s procured to 120.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Conflict with China</strong><br /><br />
            The real test of IAF airlift capability came in October 1962, when
            open warfare erupted on the Sino-lndian border. During the period 20
            October to 20 November, pressure on the Service's transport and
            helicopter units were intense, troops and supplies having to be
            flown to the support of the border posts virtually around the clock
            and at extreme altitudes. The helicopters had to constantly run the
            gauntlet of Chinese small arms and anti-aircraft fire, while
            operating to.the tricky helipads in the mountains. Many notable
            feats were performed by the IAF during this conflict, including the
            operation of C-119Gs from airstrips 17,000 ft (5180m) above sea
            level in the Karakoram Himalayas, and the air-lifting by An-12Bs of
            two troops of AMX-13 light tanks to Chushul, in Ladakh, where the
            small airstrip was 15,000 ft (4570m) above sea level. <br /><br />
            The state of emergency declared as a result of the Sino-lndian
            fighting resulted in disbandment of the Auxillary Air Force and
            absorption of its personnel and equipment by the regular IAF. An
            emergency training scheme was instituted in which the services of
            five flying clubs at Madras, Kanpur, New Delhi, Nagpur and Patiala
            were enlisted, more than 1,000 cadets receiving primary flying
            instruction with these clubs by the end of 1964. Furthermore,
            Vampire FBMk.52s "mothballed" since 1961, were restored to service
            as the equipment of newly-raised squadrons. <br /><br />
            The IAF was expanding rapidly, its personnel strength of 28,000
            officers and men at the time of the Sino-lndian conflict increasing
            by some two-thirds by the end of 1964, but the manpower requirements
            of the 33-squadron force had still to be implemented fully when the
            scheme was overtaken by even more ambitious expansion to a
            45-squadron force which was sanctioned by the Government in October
            1962, this calling for the raising of IAF personnel strength to some
            100,000 by the early seventies. <br /><br />
            Together with the arrival of successive batches of An- 12Bs from the
            Soviet Union and a third batch of C- 119Gs from the USA, the IAF
            began to receive the Canadian DHC-4 Caribou, two being presented to
            the Service by the Canadian Government as assistance in wake of the
            Sino-lndian conflict and 16 more being ordered, with deliveries
            commencing in September 1963, resulting in the establishment of
            No.33 Squadron. <br /><br />
            FairchildAn epoch-making decision was taken in August 1962 which was
            to profoundly alter the complexion and strength of the Indian Air
            Force into the decades ahead. The Government of India signed
            protocols with the Soviet Union for the very first supply of combat
            aircraft and missiles for the Indian Air Force. The purchase of 12
            MiG-21 fighters from the Soviet Union - the IAF's first combat
            aircraft of non-western origin - and for Soviet technical assistance
            in setting up production facilities for the fighter in India was
            followed by the procurement of SA-2 (Dvina) surface-to-air missiles.
            Re-equipment and expansion of the IAF was now being pursued in
            parallel with major changes in the operational infrastructure. Prior
            to the Sino-lndian conflict, the IAF had been geared to provide
            defence against attack from the West only, but appreciation of the
            vulnerability of the entire Northern and Eastern border had called
            for profound rethinking of the operational infrastructure.
            <br /><br />
            DHC4It was now patently apparent that, for a country of the
            immensity of India, a system of purely functional Commands was
            impracticable and that, to cater for all potential-threats,
            operational command would in future, have to be exercised on a
            regional basis. Thus the Indian periphery was divided into three for
            purposes of operational control, the Western, Central and Eastern
            Air Commands eventually emerging. However, in order to maintain
            uniform standards in training and maintenance, the Training and
            Maintenance Commands were to remain functional.

          <p>
            Tension between India and Pakistan had steadily escalated over the
            years, culminating on 1 September 1965 in a massive attack in the
            Chhamb sector by Pakistani forces. Possessing the initiative in
            having chosen the time and place to strike and enjoying overwhelming
            numerical superiority in the sector in both armour and troops,
            Pakistan posed a grave threat to Indian forces on the ground and so,
            in response to urgent requests for air strikes against Pakistani
            armour advancing in the Chhamb-Jaurian sector, Vampire FBMk.52s of
            No. 45 Squadron, at the time undergoing operational training at a
            forward base, mounted their first sorties at 1745 hours on the first
            day of the conflict, and on their heels came the Mysteres of Nos.3
            and 31 Squadrons operating from Pathankot. The Pakistani armoured
            thrust was staggered. IAF Gnats proved their mettle in shooting down
            PAF Sabres in this sector, the first of aerial victories being
            notched by Nos. 23 and 9 Squadrons. Rapidly escalating, full scale
            warfare broke out on 6 September all along the international border
            between West Pakistan and India. <br /><br />
            In the days that followed, IAF Canberras raided the major PAF bases
            at Sargodha and Chaklala at night, flying 200 counter air and
            interdiction missions against these and other Pakistani bases,
            including those at Akwal, Peshawar, Kohat, ChakJhumra and Risalwala.
            The virtuosity of the Hunters was fully demonstrated, Nos. 7, 20 and
            27 Squadrons being employed in counter-air as well as interdiction
            and close air support missions in the West while Hunters of No. 14
            Squadron battled with Sabres of the PAF No. 14 squadron raiding the
            IAF base at Kalaikunda in the East. The Mysteres were employed
            primarily in the ground attack role in which they proved extremely
            effective, with their swaths of 5 5 mm rockets most effective
            against armoured vehicles. Perhaps the most outstanding operational
            success was enjoyed by the Gnat, the three squadrons of which
            provided the air defence mainstay by flying CAPs over most
            operational IAF bases as well as fulfilling escort missions. Indeed,
            such was its success particularly against the F-86, that it was to
            earn the appellation of "Sabre Slayer". The September conflict was
            the first full-scale war in which the post-independence IAF was
            involved and the Service learned many lessons as a result. Post
            mortem examination revealed some requirements, the pace of expansion
            being slowed while lessons were digested. It was realised that too
            much emphasis had been placed on quantity at some cost in quality in
            order to cater for the dictates of the very high tempo IAF expansion
            embarked upon following the Sino-Indian War. This had necessitated
            cutting the duration of training courses to maximise personnel
            output and there was evidence that this could have some adverse
            effect on operational efficiency.. Emphasis was now reversed in that
            quality once more took precedence over quanitity and training
            underwent major reorganization in consequence.

          <p>
            There could, of course, be no abatement in equipment modernisation.
            While the Indo-Pakistan conflict had underlined the vital importance
            of the state or readiness of the men flying and servicing the
            aircraft, their training and motivation, the efficacy of their
            equipment was of equal concern. When the September 1965 hostilities
            began, the MiG-21 had still to achieve operational status. No. 28
            Squadron had been formed on the MiG-21 clear-weather day intercept
            model but was still very much a trials unit then flying localised
            CAPs. Early acquisition of MiG-21s of a later and more potent
            version was considered essential to accelerate re-equipment of
            squadrons still flying such patently obsolete types as the Vampire
            FBMk.52. Thus sufficient numbers of the improved MiG-21FL (Type 77
            in IAF parlance) were imported in flyaway condition to initiate the
            programme, and these, together with others imported in CKD form for
            HAL assembly, were to be sufficient for the re-equipment of nine
            squadrons during the period 1966-69. <br /><br />
            Owing to the success enjoyed by the Gnat during the conflict, plans
            for its early-1966 phase-out by HAL were halted and production was
            fully reinstated, to result in a further four Gnat squadrons (Nos
            15, 21, 22 and 24) being formed during 1966-68. Delay in
            availability of the HAL-designed HF-24 Marut for the ground attack
            fighter mission led, in 1966, to the IAF evaluating and the
            Government purchasing the Sukhoi Su-7BM, deliveries of which from
            the Soviet Union were to commence in March 1968, with No.26 Squadron
            being the first of a half-dozen squadrons that were to operate the
            type. Within three years of the Indo-Pakistan conflict, the IAF,
            which had achieved equal status with the Army on 15 January 1966,
            possessed in excess of 70,000 personnel and was nearing its
            45-squadron goal. Its composition in the autumn of 1968 included 23
            fighter category squadrons, three tactical bomber squadrons, a
            maritime patrol squadron (with ex-Air India L. 1049G Super
            Constellations), 11 transport squadrons, four AOP squadrons, a
            number of helicopter units and a few SAM squadrons.
            <br /><br />
            Numerically predominating in the fighter inventory was the Gnat,
            equipping eight squadrons; six squadrons were equipped with the
            Hunter, a further four on the MiG-21FL and two on the Mystere IVA.
            Two squadrons fulfilled the photo-recce fighter role with adapted
            Vampire T Mk. 55s and one squadron was operating the HF-24 Marut.
            The bombing element comprised three squadrons equipped with the
            Canberra; the maritime reconnaissance unit, No. 6 Sqn, had finally
            relinquished its Liberators late in 1967, and was operating adapted
            L- 1049G Super Constellations. The airlift component consisted of
            two squadrons with An- 12Bs, three with C- 119Gs, three with C-47s,
            two with Otters and one each with 11-14s and Caribous while one
            squadron was in process of converting from the C-47 to the HS. 748.
            The AOP squadrons operated a mix of Auster AOP-9s and HAL-designed
            HAOP-27 Krishaks, and the Helicopter Units, which were not formed
            into separate squadrons, were equipped with the Mi-4 and the
            Alouette 111 (Chetak). As the sixties translated to the seventies,
            the IAF consolidated its expansion plans, attaining its 45-squadron
            goal. Obsolescent equipment was steadily withdrawn to be succeeded
            by increasing numbers of HF-24s, MiG-21FLs and SU-7BMs and in March
            1971, planning began on the creation of an extensive Air Defence
            Ground Environment System (ADGES), the emphasis initially being
            placed on strengthening surveillance of the Sino-lndian border.
            Flying training was rationalised and expanded and, inJanuary 1971,
            the Air Force Academy at Dundigal (near Hyderabad) was inaugurated.

          <summary><h3 id="1971">The War of December 1971</h3></summary>
          <p>
            The professional standards, capability and flexibility of the much
            expanded Service were soon to be put to the acid test. From early
            1971, as the political situation on the sub-continent deteriorated,
            the IAF was alerted to the possibility of another armed conflict.
            For some weeks in November, both Indian and Pakistan governments
            protested violations of national airspace along the western border,
            but aerial conflict between the respective air arms began in earnest
            on 22 November, preceding full-scale warfare between India and
            Pakistan by 12 days. At 1449 hours, four Pakistani Sabres strafed
            Indian and Mukti Bahini positions in the Chowgacha Mor area, and 10
            minutes later, while engaged on a third strafing run, the Sabres
            were intercepted by four Gnats from No. 22 Sqn, a detachment of
            which was operating from Dum Dum Airport, Calcutta. During the
            ensuing melee, three of the Sabres were shot down, all Gnats
            returning to base unscathed. The first blood of a new Indo-Pakistan
            air war had been drawn. Other encounters were to follow over the
            next 10 days, within both Indian and Pakistani airspace, before
            full-scale war began on 3 December. Pre-emptive strikes were
            launched by the Pakistan Air Force against IAF bases at Srinagar,
            Amritsar and Pathankot, followed by attacks on Ambala, Agra,
            Jodhpur, Uttarlai, Avantipur, Faridkot, Halwara and Sirsa. Apart
            from IAF bases, the PAF attacked railway stations, Indian armour
            concentrations and other targets. In response and during the ensuing
            two weeks, the IAF carried out some 4,000 sorties in the West from
            major and forward bases in Jammu, Kashmir, Punjab and Rajasthan,
            while, in the East, a further 1,978 sorties were flown. <br /><br />
            Throughout the conflict, in which Indian strategy was to maintain
            basically defensive postures on the western and northern fronts
            whilst placing emphasis on a lightning campaign in the east, the IAF
            established a highly credible serviceability rate which exceeded 80
            per cent. Mission emphasis throughout was on interdiction. In the
            West the IAF's primary tasks were disruption of enemy
            communications, the destruction of fuel and ammunition reserves, and
            the prevention of any ground force concentrations so that no major
            offensive could be mounted against India while Indian forces were
            primarily engaged in the East. On the Eastern front, the Indian
            forces launched a sophisticated campaign which included rapid-moving
            infantry and armour advancing from three directions, airborne and
            heliborne assaults, missile bombardments from ships and an
            amphibious landing, the IAF's task being primarily direct support of
            the ground forces. In a classic air action in the Western desert,
            four Hunters of the OCU, detachment at Jaisalmer destroyed an entire
            armoured regiment at Longewala, literally stopping the enemy
            offensive in its tracks. <br /><br />
            The IAF had good reason for satisfaction with its showing during the
            December 1971 conflict. Although Pakistan had initiated the war with
            pre-emptive air strikes against major forward air bases, the IAF
            rapidly gained the initiative and had thereafter dominated the skies
            over both fronts. Admittedly, there had to be war losses but the IAF
            flew many more sorties than its opponent with interdiction missions
            predominating, and the bulk of the Service's attrition was the
            result of intensive anti-aircraft fire; in aerial combat, the IAF
            proved its superiority in no uncertain manner. First round had gone
            to the Gnats, again, but its later compatriots, the MiG-21s, were to
            shortly demonstrate the superiority of this supersonic fighter,
            flown by professionals. Six squadrons of MiG-21FLs were part of the
            IAF's order-of battle, participating in operations both in the
            Eastern and Western Sectors. Three MiG-21 squadrons, operating from
            Gauhati and Tezpur,took part in counter-air, escort and close air
            support tasks during the blitzkrieg action in Bangladesh. That the
            MiG-21 was highly effective in short range, precision attacks was
            amply demonstrated during the attacks with 500 kg bombs on the PAF's
            air bases at Tezgaon and Kurmitola, while pin point 57 mm rocket
            attacks were carried out against key command centres in the capital
            Dacca itself. <br /><br />
            It was in the Western theatre that the MiG-21 was employed in its
            primary task, that of air defence, escort and interception. Deployed
            at all the major air bases, from Pathankot in the north to Jamnagar
            in the South Western area, the MiG-21FLs mounted hundreds of combat
            air patrol sorties over Vital Points (VP) and Vital Areas (VA), flew
            escort missions for bombers and strike fighters and were
            continuously scrambled to intercept hostile intruders. The MiG-21
            finally met its original adversary, the F- 104 Starfighter, in air
            combat over the Subcontinent during the December 1971 conflict and
            in all four recorded cases of classic dog fights, the MiG-21s
            outclassed and out fought the F- 104s. The first aerial victory was
            on 12 December 1971, when MiG-21FLs of No. 47 Squadron shot down a
            PAF F-104 over the Gulf of Kutch and this was followed by three more
            victories in quick succession on 17 December, when MiG-21FLs of No.
            29 Squadron escorting HF-24 Maruts, shot down intercepting F-104s
            near Uttarlai in the Rajsthan desert in gun-missile encounters,
            while a third F-104, on an intruding mission, was shot down by
            another MiG 21FL of No.29 Squadron. <br /><br />
            The December 1971 war also meant the gaining of India's highest
            award for gallantry to the IAF. Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh
            Sekhon, flying Gnats with No. 18 Squadron from Srinagar, was
            posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra. Notwithstanding the
            successful campaign of December 1971 which created both history and
            geography, the Indian Air Force had lessons to draw from subsequent
            analyses of the conflict, although for the most part, these lessons
            dictated refinement rather than any fundamental change. <br /><br />

          </summary>
          <p>
            Aircraft Systems Testing Establishment (ASTE) the Tactics & Air
            Combat Development Establishment, (TACDE), the 'College of Air
            Combat' and other specialist establiments continued to mature. Work
            on the ADGES was resumed in 1974-75 and plans for the qualitative
            upgrading of the entire Air Force were continually refined. The IAF
            handed over its Super Constellations to the Navy in 1975. The early
            seventies saw force levels being consolidated, and training in new
            weapons-systems and evolution of new tactics being honed.
            <br /><br />
            By the mid '70s, the IAF was clearly in need of urgent re-equipment
            decisions and various requirements, better known by their acronyms
            DPSA, TASA, METAC and HETAC, were pursued and decisions were
            forthcoming at last. The period, the IAF was to benefit from a crest
            in the eighties, the period 1978-88 witnessing a major modernisation
            programme which replaced most of the earlier generation and obsolete
            equipment with spanking new aircraft types and weapon systems. No
            less than twenty new aircraft types and sub-types entered the IAF's
            service over these years, including various strike fighters,
            third-generation supersonic interceptors, tri-sonic reconnaissance
            aircraft, strategic heavy lift transports, medium tactical
            transports, light transport aircraft, heavy lift and medium-assault
            helicopters, basic trainers, surface-to-air missiles and an array of
            sophisticated weaponry propelling the IAF, or Bharatiya Vayu Sena,
            into one of the world's better equipped air arms. <br /><br />
            First off the mark was selection of the Jaguar strike fighter, to
            meet the IAF's urgent Deep Penetration Strike Aircraft (DPSA)
            requirement, to replace the Canberra and Hunter still soldiering on
            in this exacting role. After many years of evaluation and
            negotiation, the Anglo-French fighter was contracted for, an interim
            batch of ex-RAF Jaguars being accepted to re-equip No. 14 Squadron.
            IAF pilots and technicians received conversion training with the RAF
            and British Aerospace in Lossiemouth, Coltishall and Warton before
            ferrying the first Jaguars to India in July 1979. These were
            followed by a batch of U.K. built Jaguars to re-equip No. 5 Squadron
            even as simultaneously, HAL prepared for production of the aircraft,
            its powerplants, avionics and accessories in India. By the mid-80s,
            the Jaguar was in service with Nos. 5, 14, 16 and 27 Squadrons while
            a flight of No.6 Squadron was equipped with the Maritime Jaguar
            carrying the new generation Sea Eagle anti-ship sea-skimming
            missile. The Jaguar strike fighter was equipped also with Magic
            air-to-air missiles on unique overwing pylons, featured advanced
            nay-attack systems and able to carry formidable warload till the far
            ends of the sub-continent.
            <br /><br />
            Meanwhile, in 1976, the "third generation" MiG-21bis, considered the
            definitive variant of the classic tailed-delta fighter design, was
            to follow-on the "M" sub-type, as a multi-role air
            superiority/ground attack version. The MiG-21bis assumed the prime
            air defence mantle and sufficient numbers were acquired in 1976-77
            to equip three squadrons (Nos. 15, 21 and 23) formerly operating the
            Gnat light fighter. With some 580 MiG-21s delivered by HAL and
            nearly 250 MiG-21s (including the two-seat operational trainers)
            imported as "fly aways", the type remained an immense asset for the
            Indian Air Force for over a quarter century. The quantity vs.
            quality dilemma inevitably faced by most of the world's air forces
            as a consequence of spiralling costs was mitigated for the IAF by
            the large scale availability of the MiG-21, which type will surely
            go down as one of aviation history's all-time classics. <br /><br />
            The next requirement to be met was for a Tactical Air Strike
            Aircraft (TASA). With the various development programmes to enhance
            the operational performance of the HF-24 Marut by HAL abandoned for
            one reason or the other, the Government of India concluded an
            agreement with the Soviet Union for the MiG-23 variable-sweep
            fighter. Four squadrons, then flying the HF-24 and Sukhoi Su-7 were
            re-equipped with the MiG-23BN and induction into IAF service of this
            swing-wing fighter. Nos. 10 and 220 Squadrons were shortly
            operational on the new type and Nos. 31 and 221 followed to add a
            considerable measure of potency to the offensive air support
            formations of the IAF. The dedicated strike derivative, selected for
            licence production by HAL, was the MiG-27M which shared the overall
            configuration of the BN but was optimised for low-level, high-speed
            performance. The last Sukhoi Su-7 Squadron (No.222) became the first
            MiG-27M unit and the Ajeet light fighter squadrons were gradually
            re-equipped with the MiG-27ML, No.9 being followed by Nos.18,22 and
            lately, No.2. <br /><br />
            Induction of the new generation F-16 fighter by the PAF in 1981-82
            was a "dejavu" type situation for India and in order to counter such
            a challenge, the Government contracted for the MiG-23MF air
            superiority version of the swing-wing fighter, equipped with
            beyond-visual range missiles, and two new squadrons (Nos. 223 and
            224) were formed on the type in 1982. However, these were considered
            only an interim solution and, in the absence of suitable, known,
            Soviet equivalents, India turned to Western sources for an advanced
            technology interceptor. In 1982, a contract was finalised with
            France for the Mirage 2000 delta-wing, fly-by-wire fighter, with
            high agility and a formidable radar/missile combination. IAF pilots
            and technicians had converted to the Mirage 2000 at Mont de Marsan
            and ferried the fighters from France in the summer of 1985. Two
            squadrons (Nos. 1 and 7) were re-equipped with the new French
            fighter in 1985-86 and the Indian Air Force employed this multi-role
            advanced technology fighter to good effect in a number of actions
            within the next few years. <br /><br />
            Not too long afterwards, the Indian Air Force was, to be pleasantly
            surprised when its test pilots were invited to evaluate the Soviet
            Union's latest, still-under-wraps, air superiority fighter, vaguely
            known to the public as the Fulcrum. Officially designated the
            MiG-29, the IAF team was obviously delighted by the new generation
            fighter's performance and handling qualities, described as "truly
            outstanding". Two years were to pass, however, before the
            Governments of India and the Soviet Union formalised an agreement
            for supply of the MiG-29, integrated with contemporary pulse doppler
            radar and new weapon systems. <br /><br />

              Op Safed Sagar : Understanding Air Operations in Kargil
            </h3>
          </summary>
          <p>
            <strong>Introduction</strong><br /><br />
            The IAF was first approached to provide air support on 11 May 99
            with the use of helicopters. This was followed by ago ahead given on
            25 May by the CCS to the IAF to mount attacks on the infiltrators
            without crossing the LoC. While there was considerable pressure from
            outside the IAF to operate only attack helicopters, the CAS
            succeeded in convincing the Govt that in order to create a suitable
            environment for the helicopters, fighter action was required.
            <br /><br />
            Operation Safedsagar, as the air operations in the Kargil area were
            called, was, indeed, a milestone in the history of military
            aviation, as this was the first time that air power was employed in
            such an environment.<br /><br /><strong
              >Effect of Environment</strong
            ><br /><br />The severe degradation of aircraft and weapon
            performance is difficult for the layman to completely appreciate. No
            aircraft has yet been designed to operate in a Kargil-like
            environment. At high altitudes, a crucial factor in aircraft
            performance is the reserve of power available, which, for the MiG
            and Mirage fleets, was a strong point in their favor. In
            comparision, the Fairchild A-10, which was widely quoted as being
            the ideal platform, would have been a misfit. It is widely (and
            incorrectly) stated that using Mach 2 aircraft would not produce
            results; however, all air-to-ground attack speeds are approximately
            the same attack speeds (750-950 kmph) for all fixed-wing
            aircraft.<br /><br />
            Due to the very different attributes of the atmosphere, even weapons
            do not perform as per sea-level specifications. Variations in air
            temperature and density, altering drag indices and a host of other
            factors (which have never been calculated by any manufacturer for
            this type of altitude) cause weapons to go off their mark; for the
            same reasons, normally reliable computerised weapon aiming devices
            give inaccurate results.<br /><br />
            In the plains, a 1000 pounder bomb landing 25 yards away from the
            target would still severely disable, if not flatten, it. In the
            mountains, however, a miss of a few yards would be as good as the
            proverbial mile, due to the undulating terrain and masking effects.
            In addition, due to the variation in elevation the "miss" would be
            greatly magnified in the linear dimension, further exaggerating the
            "inaccuracy" of the weapon/delivery. While this would lead to
            apparent inaccuracies in weapon delivery, there is, thus, a need for
            pinpoint accuracy in conditions where that very attribute is
            severely degraded by the factors mentioned above.<br /><br />
            <strong>The First Few Days</strong>
            <br /><br />
            The loss of one fighter and one Mi-17 chopper to enemy action
            indicated the need for a change of tactics, resulting in withdrawal
            of armed helicopters and employment of fighters in modified profiles
            out of the Stinger SAM envelope. By itself, the change of tactics is
            nothing unusual, and is an inherent part of the qualities of
            flexibility and adaptability; in fact, a far more serious lapse
            would be a dogged tendency to persist in sacrificing assets when,
            clearly, there was a need for a re-assessment. It is, perhaps for
            this reason that NATO, after deploying 100 Apache attack helicopters
            in Greece, reconsidered bringing them into Kosovo till the shooting
            was over, as they felt the environment didn't justify it.
            Unfortunately, IAF Mi-25/35 attack helicopters were not able to
            operate in this terrain.
            <br /><br />
            One of the many facts that have emerged clearly is that target
            acquisition by the pilot is the bottom line. Totally unfamiliar
            surroundings in the Kargil area made target recognition difficult
            from the ground, let alone from a fast moving aircraft. As a result,
            the initial few sorties from high levels were not effective as
            desired. However, once revised and modified profiles, tactics and
            manner of system usage had been perfected, the accuracy of the
            airstrikes improved dramatically. Any time the target was spotted, a
            very high success rate invariably resulted.<br /><br />

              >Air Reconnaissance And Battle Damage Assessment : Crucial Aspects
              Of An Air War</strong
            ><br /><br />
            The picture one normally associates with airstrikes emphasises
            helmeted pilots starting up their aircraft, flying to the target in
            the teeth of intense anti-aircraft fire and battling their way
            through hordes of enemy fighters to press home their attacks despite
            superhuman odds. In all fairness, that's the way it actually
            happened until the Second World War - the famous 1000 bomber raids
            over Germany, with the US 8th Air Force flying by day and the RAF by
            night, at a terrible cost in lives and machines.<br /><br />
            Even at that time, though, the "back-room boys", that anonymous
            bunch of faceless experts who lived their lives poring over
            reconnaissance (recce) photographs, noting detail after painstaking
            detail, provided the target information that ultimately formed the
            basis of the bombing missions. <br /><br />
            <strong> Three Main Steps in Neutralising a Target.</strong
            ><br /><br />
            Far from being an off-the-cuff quick reaction affair, each airstrike
            is the end result of a carefully planned chain of events spanning
            several areas of specialisation. Broadly speaking, an airstrike
            would have the following components:- <br /><br />
            (a) Recce mission(s). <br /><br />
            (b) Airstrike mission(s). <br /><br />
            (c) Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) mission(s). <br /><br />
            (d) If so dictated by results of BDA, or by follow-up recce,
            repeated airstrikes. <br /><br />
            <strong>The Increasing Effects of Airstrikes</strong><br /><br />
            As a result of these attacks, severe damage to enemy personnel and
            equipment became apparent in various areas. It is surmised that
            airstrikes contributed to a significant portion of the enemy's
            casualty list, as apparent in the numbers. However, the most telling
            effects on the ground were from intercepts of enemy radio revealing
            severe shortage of rations, water, medicines and ammunition. Losses
            due to airstrikes and inability to evacuate their casualties were
            also mentioned in the intercepts.
            <strong
              ><i
                >This was theactual manifestation on the ground of the result of
                effective airstrikes by the IAF</i
              ></strong
            >. The effect of accurate attacks is best summed up by a message
            received from one of the HQ of the Indian Army....... <br /><br />
            "You guys have done a wonderful job. Your Mirage boys with their
            precision laser guided bombs targeted an enemy Battalion HQ in Tiger
            Hill area with tremendous success. Five Pakistani officers reported
            killed in that attack and their Command and Control broke down - as
            a result of which our troops have literally walked over the entire
            Tiger Hills area. The enemy is on the run. They are on the run in
            other sectors also. At this rate the end of the conflict may come
            soon."<br /><br />

            <strong>IAF Air Strikes : the Results</strong><br /><br />

            IAF air strikes against enemy supply camps and other targets yielded
            rich dividends. A noteworthy fact is that there was not a single
            operation on ground that was not preceded by airstrikes, each and
            every one of which was the result of coordinated planning between 15
            Corps and the AOC, J&K. However, one of the valuable lessons that
            emerged was the need for joint Army-Air Force planning and
            consultations from the very beginning, where the Air Force would be
            able to contribute by rendering advice on targeting which could, at
            the very outset, be incorporated into the Army plan of ground
            operations. This would prove far more effective than a case where
            the Army proceeded as per its own plans made earlier in isolation,
            and called for air support when they felt it was required.
            <br /><br />
            <strong><i>Firstly</i></strong
            >, in the area of interdiction of enemy supplies, the successful and
            incessant attacks on the enemy's logistic machine had, over the last
            few weeks, culminated in a serious degradation of the enemy's
            ability to sustain himself in an increasing number of areas. The
            series of attacks against Pt 4388 in the Dras sector was an
            excellent example of how lethal airstrikes combined with timely
            reconnaissance detected the enemy plans to shift to alternate supply
            routes which were once again effectively attacked. In this the IAF
            succeeded in strangling the enemy supply arteries, amply testified
            to by enemy radio intercepts. The primacy of interdiction targets as
            opposed to Battlefield Air Strikes (BAS) targets was clearly brought
            out, as also the fact that air power is not to be frittered away on
            insignificant targets like machine gun posts and trenches, but on
            large targets of consequence (like the supply camp at Muntho Dhalo,
            enemy Battalion HQ on top of Tiger Hill, etc). Gone are the days of
            fighters screaming in at deck level, acting as a piece of extended
            artillery. The air defence environment of today's battlefield just
            does not permit such employment of airpower anymore, a significant
            fact that needs to be understood by soldier and civilian alike.
            <br /><br />
            The <strong><i>second</i></strong> major impact of air power in this
            operation was in the area of casualties. Normally, an enemy
            defending a well fortified position (in this case, Pakistan) suffers
            between 3-6 times less casualties than does the force on the
            offensive. However, this operation has seen the reverse, with the
            enemy casualties far in excess of those suffered by us. One
            significant fact must not be lost sight of; of the two warring
            sides, it is the Pakistani Army that suffered air strikes, which,
            obviously, contributed significantly to its casualties. It is felt
            that without the use of air power, our own casualties could have
            approached if not exceeded four figures. <br /><br />
            The <strong><i>third</i></strong> aspect is that of attack chopper
            operations. IAF dedicated attack choppers like the Mi-35 were
            incapable of operating at that altitude, which prompted the use of
            armed and modified Mi-17s for the role. Besides the capability of
            the machine itself vis-a-vis the area of operation, the creation of
            the right air defence environment is a crucial factor which would
            determine the employment of this platform. Effectiveness versus
            vulnerability would need to be examined; during Op Safedsagar, the
            abundance of man portable SAMs in all enemy-held areas precluded the
            effective employment of attack choppers. As a result, whether Army
            or IAF, choppers were constrained to operate in SAM-free areas.
            Nevertheless, IAF Cheetahs were instrumental in carrying out front
            line roles like providing a platform for the Airborne Forward Air
            Controller (FAC), a fighter pilot who guides the fighters in to the
            attack against ground targets. <br />
            <br />
            The <strong><i>fourth</i></strong> major impact of air power is in
            the enormous difference it made to the ground operations, no better
            example of which exists than the message from the HQ of a field Army
            unit, (shown in italics above) stating that " as a result of the
            precision airstrikes on Tiger Hills our troops have literally walked
            over the entire Tiger Hills area. The enemy is on the run.."
            <br /><br />

            <strong><i> Fifthly</i></strong
            >, night operations were carried out using ingenuity and
            imagination; at times, excellent results were achieved by aircraft
            like MiG-21s using little else but a stop watch and a GPS receiver.
            These operations had a significant effect on the enemy's resilience,
            stamina and very will to fight. <br /><br />

            <strong><i>Sixthly</i></strong
            >, the effort put into air defence escorts and area Combat Air
            Patrolling by day as well as night proved an effective deterrent
            which ensured total air superiority. At times, PAF F-16s orbited a
            scant 15 kms (on their own side of the LOC) from our strike
            formations attacking Pakistani targets, kept at bay by our own air
            defence fighters flying a protective pattern above the strike.
            <br /><br />
            The
            <strong><i>seventh</i></strong> aspect is the high degree of
            imagination, felexibility and IAF-Army coordination which marked
            every phase of the operation. In the
            <strong><i>final</i></strong> analysis, the effective application of
            air power has indisputably saved further casualties as well as
            compressed considerably the timeframe in which our Army has made
            such progress on the ground. In this context, the basic functions of
            air power have been repeated, though on a much larger scale, when
            compared to the IAF's operations in this area during 1947-48, when
            IAF Tempests carried out strafing and rocket attacks on the
            intruders and Dakotas ferried in as well as paradropped troops and
            supplies. As then and now, when called upon by the nation the IAF
            has joined as an equal partner to the Army to meet the national
            objective. <br /><br />

            <strong>Conclusion</strong><br /><br />

            Almost from the very beginning of the operations, IAF intellects
            were busy ticking over in a near constant brain-storming session
            aimed at deriving lessons from Operation Safedsagar. Being an
            ongoing process, the immense experience gained from this operation
            would stand in good stead in the times to come. These lessons would
            be applicable to all the world's Air Forces, for it is the first
            time in the history of military aviation that such an air operation
            took place in such an environment. While conventional long-accepted
            air power theories no longer held good, a new set of operating
            paradigms had to be evolved almost overnight to cope with the
            situation. This is the first time the IAF fought a limited war,
            hitherto thought to be an unlikely eventuality, as air power and
            escalation to an all-out war were thought to be synonymous. The
            deterrent effect of air power has been enhanced by this fact, as the
            prospect of decisive air action is now a proven possibility in even
            a Low Intensity Conflict situation. Operation Safedsagar was,
            therefore, a turning point in the history of military aviation, and
            an operation that will, no doubt, be discussed and dissected for the
            next few years.
