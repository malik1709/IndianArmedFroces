          Arjan Singh has remained a source of inspiration to fellow Indians and
          Officers. His simple formula for success is summed up in a few words
          by him.<br /><br />
          <strong
            ><i
              >Firstly, you should be thorough in your profession of everyone;
              <br />
              Secondly, complete the job at hand to the satisfaction of
              everyone; <br />
              Thirdly, you must have implicit faith in your subordinates; <br />
              And fourthly, your efforts should always be honest and sincere.</i
            ></strong
          ><br /><br />
          YB Chavan, Defence minister of India during the 1965 war described him
          as the jewel of a person, quietly efficient and firm, unexcitable but
          a very able leader.<br /><br />
          After retiring from the IAF, Arjan Singh remained active and
          supportive of various causes for the welfare of air force veterans.
          Towards this end, he set up a trust in 2004 by contributing Twenty
          million rupees from his personal wealth to it.<br /><br />
          On 17 April 2007, Dr Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, wrote to
          Arjan Singh and honoured him as Marshal of the Air Force and mentioned
          that the nation looked up to him as a source of continuing
          inspiration, wisdom and strength to the Indian Armed Forces.<br /><br />
          Marshal of the IAF Arjan Singh passed away on 16 Sep 2017. His dynamic
          personality, professional competence, honesty of purpose in his
          service to the IAF and the country truly sets him apart as a leader
          and an icon of the Indian Air Force.
