      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        India has one of the longest military histories, dating back several
        millennia. The first reference to armies is found in the Vedas as well
        as the epics Ramayana and Mahabaratha. Classical Indian texts on archery
        in particular, and martial arts in general are known as Dhanurveda.
      </p>

      <h3>Ancient to medieval era</h3>
      <p>
        Indian maritime history dates back 5,000 years. The first tidal dock is
        believed to have been built at Lothal around 2300 BC during the Indus
        Valley Civilisation period, near the present day port of Mangrol on the
        Gujarat coast. The Rig Veda written around 1500 BC, credits Varuna with
        knowledge of the ocean routes and describes naval expeditions. There is
        reference to the side wings of a vessel called Plava, which gives the
        ship stability in storm conditions. A compass, Matsya yantra was used
        for navigation in the fourth and fifth century AD. The earliest known
        reference to an organisation devoted to ships in ancient India is in the
        Mauryan Empire from the 4th century BC. Powerful militaries included
        those of the: Maurya, Satavahana, Chola, Vijayanagara, Mughal and
        Maratha empires. Emperor Chandragupta Maurya's mentor and advisor
        Chanakya's Arthashastra devotes a full chapter on the state department
        of waterways under navadhyaksha (Sanskrit for Superintendent of ships).
        The term, nava dvipantaragamanam (Sanskrit for "sailing to other lands
        by ships," i.e. exploration) appears in this book in addition to
        appearing in the Vedic text, Baudhayana Dharmashastra as the
        interpretation of the term, Samudrasamyanam. Sea lanes between India and
        neighbouring lands were used for trade for many centuries, and are
        responsible for the widespread influence of Indian Culture on other
        societies. The Cholas excelled in foreign trade and maritime activity,
        extending their influence overseas to China and Southeast Asia. During
        the 17th and 18th centuries, the Maratha and Kerala fleets were
        expanded, and became the most powerful Naval Forces in the subcontinent,
        defeating European navies at various times (See the Battle of Colachel).
        The fleet review of the Maratha navy, at which the ships Pal and Qalbat
        participated, took place at the Ratnagiri fort. The Maratha Kanhoji
        Angre, and Kunjali Marakkar, the Naval chief of Saamoothiri were two
        notable naval chiefs of the period.
      </p>

      <h3>British India (1857 to 1947)</h3>
      <p>
        The Royal Indian Navy was first established by the British while much of
        India was under the control of the East India Company. In 1892, it
        became a maritime component as the Royal Indian Marine (RIM). During
        World War I the Indian Army contributed a number of divisions and
        independent brigades to the European, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern
        theatres of war. One million Indian troops served overseas; 62,000 died
        and another 67,000 were wounded. In total, 74,187 Indian soldiers died
        during the war. It fought against the German Empire in German East
        Africa and on the Western Front. Indian divisions were also sent to
        Egypt, Gallipoli and nearly 700,000 served in Mesopotamia against the
        Ottoman Empire. Following WWI, the Indian Armed Forces underwent
        significant transformation. In 1928, Engineer Sub-lieutenant D. N.
        Mukherji became the first Indian to receive a commission in the Royal
        Indian Marine. In 1932, the Indian Air Force was established as an
        auxiliary air force; two years later, the RIM was upgraded to the status
        of a naval service as the Royal Indian Navy (RIN). Though the gradual
        "Indianisation" of the officer corps began after WWI, at the outbreak of
        war in 1939, there were no Indian flag, general or air officers in the
        armed services. The highest-ranking Indian officers were those serving
        in the non-combatant Indian Medical Service, who held no rank higher
        than colonel; in the regular Indian Army, there were no Indian officers
        above the rank of major. The Royal Indian Navy had no Indian senior line
        officers and only a single Indian senior engineer officer, while the
        Indian Air Force had no Indian senior officers in 1939, with the
        highest-ranking Indian air force officer a flight lieutenant. In World
        War II, the Indian Army began the war in 1939 with just under 200,000
        men. By the end of the war it had become the largest volunteer army in
        history, rising to over 2.5 million men by August 1945. Serving in
        divisions of infantry, armour and a fledgling airborne forces, they
        fought on three continents in Africa, Europe and Asia. The Indian Army
        fought in Ethiopia against the Italian Army, in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia
        against both the Italian and German Army, and, after the Italian
        surrender, against the German Army in Italy. However, the bulk of the
        Indian Army was committed to fighting the Japanese Army, first during
        the British defeats in Malaya and the retreat from Burma to the Indian
        border; later, after resting and refitting for the victorious advance
        back into Burma, as part of the largest British Empire army ever formed.
        These campaigns cost the lives of over 36,000 Indian servicemen, while
        another 34,354 were wounded; 67,340 became prisoners of war. Their
        valour was recognised with the award of some 4,000 decorations, and 38
        members of the Indian Army were awarded the Victoria Cross or the George
        Cross. The demands of war and increasing recognition that the era of
        British dominance in the subcontinent was ending increased the pace of
        "Indianisation." In 1940, Subroto Mukherjee (later the first Indian
        C-in-C and Chief of the Air Staff) became the first Indian to command an
        air force squadron and attain the (albeit acting) rank of squadron
        leader. In July 1941, Indian Medical Service officer Hiraji Cursetji
        became one of the first Indian officers to be promoted to substantive
        general officer rank. During the war, several Indian Army officers,
        notably Kodandera M. Cariappa, S. M. Shrinagesh and Kodandera Subayya
        Thimayya, all of whom would subsequently command the Indian Army,
        achieved distinction as the first Indian battalion and brigade
        commanders. On 1 May 1945, Cariappa became the first Indian officer to
        be promoted to brigadier. At the end of hostilities in 1945, the Indian
        Army's officer corps included Indian Medical Service officer Hiraji
        Cursetji as its sole Indian major-general, one IMS brigadier, three
        Indian brigadiers in combatant arms and 220 other Indian officers in the
        temporary or acting ranks of colonel and lieutenant-colonel. From
        October 1945, the granting of regular commissions in the Indian Armed
        Forces was restricted to Indians, though provisions were made for the
        continued secondment of British officers for as long as was deemed
        necessary. In 1946, sailors of the Royal Indian Navy mutinied on board
        ships and in shore establishments. A total of 78 ships, 20 shore
        establishments and 20,000 sailors were involved in the rebellion, which
        had an impact across India. Indianization of the armed forces
        nevertheless continued to progress, though by June 1947, two months
        before Independence, the Indian Army had only 14 Indian officers at the
        rank of brigadier serving in combatant arms, with no Indian flag,
        general or air officers in the combat arms of the armed services.
      </p>

      <h3>Dominion of India (1947–1950)</h3>
      <p>
        The period immediately following Indian independence was a traumatic
        time for India and her armed services. Along with the newly independent
        India, the Indian Armed Forces were forcibly divided between India and
        Pakistan, with ships, divisions and aircraft allocated to the respective
        Dominions. Following partition, on 15 August 1947, the Indian Armed
        Forces comprised: The Royal Indian Navy (RIN): Four sloops, two
        frigates, 12 minesweepers, one corvette, one survey vessel, four armed
        trawlers, four motor minesweepers, four harbour defence launches and all
        landing craft of the pre-Independence RIN. Indian Army: 15 infantry
        regiments, 12 armoured corps units, 18.5 artillery regiments and 61
        engineer units. Of the Nepalese Gorkha regiments formerly attached to
        the British Indian Army, the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th (Royal), 8th and 9th
        Gorkha Rifles remained in Indian service,[39] with the first and second
        battalions of the 2nd, 6th, 7th and 10th Gorkha Rifles placed in British
        Army service. The Royal Indian Air Force (RIAF): Seven fighter squadrons
        of Hawker Tempest II aircraft and one transport squadron of Douglas
        Dakota III/IV aircraft. Upon Independence on 15 August 1947, K. M.
        Cariappa and K.S. Rajendrasinhji were promoted to the rank of
        major-general from brigadier; 12 other Indian officers then held the
        rank of brigadier. By the end of 1947, there were a total of 13 Indian
        major-generals and 30 Indian brigadiers, with all three army commands
        being led by Indian officers by October 1948, at which time only 260
        British officers remained in the new Indian Army as advisers or in posts
        requiring certain technical abilities. With effect from April 1948, the
        former Viceroy's Commissioned Officers (VCO) were re-designated Junior
        Commissioned Officers (JCO), the distinction between King's Commissioned
        Indian Officers (KCIO) and Indian Commissioned Officers (ICO) was
        abolished and Indian Other Ranks were re-designated as "other ranks".
        During this period, the armed forces of India were involved in a number
        of significant military operations, notably the Indo-Pakistani War of
        1947 and Operation Polo, the code name of a military operation in
        September 1948 where the Indian Armed Forces invaded the State of
        Hyderabad and overthrew its Nizam, annexing the state into the Indian
        Union. On 15 January 1949, General K. M. Cariappa was appointed the
        first Indian Commander-in-Chief of the Indian army. In February 1949,
        the Indian government repealed colonial-era legislation which mandated
        limits on the recruitment of certain ethnic groups into the armed
        forces.
      </p>

      <h3>Republic of India (1950 to present)</h3>
      <p>
        Upon India becoming a sovereign republic on 26 January 1950, some of the
        last vestiges of British rule – such as rank badges, imperial crowns,
        British ensigns and "Royal" monikers – were dropped and replaced with
        the Indian tricolour and the Lion Capital of Asoka. On 1 April 1951, the
        remaining units of Imperial Service Troops of the former princely states
        were integrated with the regular Indian Army, though only a percentage
        of the former princely states forces were found capable enough to be
        retained in active service.[47] While India had become a republic,
        British officers seconded from the British Armed Forces continued to
        hold senior positions in the Indian Armed Forces into the early 1960s.
        On 1 April 1954, Air Marshal Subroto Mukherjee became the first Indian
        Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Air Force. Effective from 1 April 1955,
        a Parliamentary Act, the Commanders-In-Chiefs (Change in Designation)
        Act, re-designated the office of Commander-in-Chief as the Chief of
        Staff of each branch. Not until 1958 would the last British chief of
        staff that of the Indian Navy, be succeeded by an Indian. On 22 April of
        that year, Vice Admiral Ram Dass Katari became the first Indian Chief of
        Naval Staff. The Chiefs of Staff of the Indian Air Force and the Indian
        Navy were upgraded to four-star rank on par with the Chief of Army Staff
        in 1966 and 1968, respectively. In 1961 tensions rose between India and
        Portugal over the Portuguese-occupied territory of Goa, which India
        claimed for itself. After Portuguese police cracked down violently on a
        peaceful, unarmed demonstration for union with India, the Indian
        government decided to invade and initiated Operation Vijay.[48] A
        lopsided air, sea, and ground campaign resulted in the speedy surrender
        of Portuguese forces. Within 36 hours, 451 years of Portuguese colonial
        rule ended, and Goa was annexed by India. Pakistan's Lt. Gen. A. A. K.
        Niazi signing the instrument of surrender in Dhaka on 16 Dec' 1971, in
        the presence of India's Lt. Gen. Aurora. Standing behind them are
        officers of India's Army, Navy and Air Force. The 1971 War directly
        involved participation of all three arms of Indian Armed Forces. India
        fought four major wars with its neighbour Pakistan in 1947, 1965, 1971
        and 1999, and with China in 1962. Indian victory over Pakistan in the
        1971 war, helped create the free country of Bangladesh. In the late
        1970s and early 1980s, Pakistan began organising tourist expeditions to
        the Siachen Glacier, disputed territory with India. Irked by this
        development, in April 1984 India initiated the successful Operation
        Meghdoot during which it gained control over all of the 70-kilometre
        (41-mile)-long Siachen Glacier, and all of its tributary glaciers, as
        well as the three main passes of the Saltoro Ridge immediately west of
        the glacier—Sia La, Bilafond La, and Gyong La. According to TIME
        magazine, India gained more than 1,000 square miles (3,000 km square) of
        territory as a result of its military operations in Siachen. In 1987 and
        in 1989 Pakistan to re-take the glacier but was unsuccessful. The
        conflict ended with Indian Victory. There has been a ceasefire since
        2003. The Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) carried out a mission in
        northern and eastern Sri Lanka in 1987–1990 to disarm the Tamil Tigers
        under the terms of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord. It was a difficult battle
        for the Indian Army, which was not trained for an unconventional war.
        After losing approximately 1,200 personnel and several T-72 tanks, India
        ultimately abandoned the mission in consultation with the Sri Lankan
        government. In what was labelled as Operation Pawan, the Indian Air
        Force flew about 70,000 sorties to and within Sri Lanka. The beginning
        of the 21st century saw a reorientation for India on the global stage
        from a regional role in the subcontinent to a major role in the Indian
        Ocean region stretching from the Gulf of Aden to the Malacca Strait.
        India's sphere of influence needs to encompass not just the South Asian
        Sub-continent, but also the northern Indian Ocean area, from the eastern
        seaboard of Africa in the west, to the Malacca Straits in the east, and
        must include Iran, Afghanistan, the Central Asian Republics (CARs),
        China and Myanmar. India's credibility, as a regional power will be
        contingent on institutional stability, economic development and military
        strength, including nuclear deterrence. The long stretches of disputed
        borders with China and Pakistan, and sizeable areas under their
        occupation, continue to be major irritants, in spite of the peace
        processes under-way with both countries.
