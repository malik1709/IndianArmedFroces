        <p>
          The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) is a maritime law enforcement and search
          and rescue agency of India with jurisdiction over its territorial
          waters including its contiguous zone and exclusive economic zone. The
          Indian Coast Guard was formally established on 1 February 1977 by the
          Coast Guard Act, 1978 of the Parliament of India.[5] It operates under
          the Ministry of Defence. <br /><br />

          The Coast Guard works in close cooperation with the Indian Navy, the
          Department of Fisheries, the Department of Revenue (Customs) and the
          Central and State police forces.

        <h3 id="ar">Assam Rifles</h3>
        <p>
          The Assam Rifles is the oldest paramilitary force of India, dating
          back to 1835 under the British Raj, raised under the name Cachar Levy.
          The present name of "Assam Rifles" has been used since 1917. Over the
          course of its history, the Assam Rifles have served in a number of
          roles, conflicts and theatres including World War I, where they served
          in Europe and the Middle East, and World War II, where they served
          mainly in Burma. After the Chinese annexation of Tibet, the Assam
          Rifles were tasked with manning the Tibet border of Assam Himalayan
          region. They were also instrumental in maintaining law and order in
          the tribal Arunachal Pradesh. <br /><br />

          The force is under the control of the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs
          (MHA). There are currently 46 battalions of Assam Rifles with a
          sanctioned strength of 63,747 personnel. They perform many roles
          including the provision of internal security under the control of the
          army through the conduct of counterinsurgency and border security
          operations, provision of aid to the civilians in times of emergency,
          and the provision of communications, medical assistance and education
          in remote areas. In times of war they can also be used as a combat
          force to secure rear areas if needed. Since 2002 the force has been
          given the role of guarding the Indo–Myanmar barrier.

        <h3 id="sff">Special Frontier Force</h3>
        <p>
          The Special Frontier Force (SFF) is an Indian special operations unit
          created on 14 November 1962. It mainly comprised Tibetan refugees
          living in India. Now it has increased in size and scope of operations.
          Its primary goal originally was to conduct covert operations behind
          Chinese lines in the event of another Sino-Indian War. Throughout its
          history, SFF has fought in India's major external wars including the
          Bangladesh Liberation War and the Kargil War. It has also been
          involved in internal security, including Operation Blue Star and also
          serving as the "Personal Force" of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to
          suppress opposition parties during the state of emergency from 1975 to
          1977. It has been part of border operations against China, including
          the 2020 China–India skirmishes. <br /><br />

          Based in Chakrata, Uttarakhand, the force was put under the direct
          supervision of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), and later the Research
          and Analysis Wing (RAW), India's external intelligence agency, and is
          not part of the Indian Army but functions under their operational
          control with its own rank structure, charter and training
          infrastructure. It falls under the authority of the Directorate
          General on Security in the Cabinet Secretariat headed by an Inspector
          General (SFF) who is selected from the Major General rank of the
          Indian Army and who reports directly to the Prime Minister's Office.
