        <h2>ORGANISATION OF MINISTRY OF DEFENCE</h2>
        <h3>Organisational Set-Up And Functions</h3>
        <p>
          After independence, the Ministry of Defence was created under the
          charge of a Cabinet Minister and each Service was placed under its own
          Commander-in-Chief. In 1955, the Commanders-in-Chief were renamed as
          the Chief of the Army Staff, the Chief of the Naval Staff and the
          Chief of the Air Staff. In November 1962, the Department of Defence
          Production was set up to deal with research, development and
          production of defence equipment. In November, 1965, the Department of
          Defence Supplies was created for planning and execution of schemes for
          import substitution of defence requirements. These two Departments
          were later merged to form the Department of Defence Production and
          Supplies. In 2004, the name of Department of Defence Production and
          Supplies was changed to Department of Defence Production. In 1980, the
          Department of Defence Research and Development was created. In 2004,
          the Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare was created. <br />
          The Defence Secretary functions as head of the Department of Defence
          and is additionally responsible for co-ordinating the activities of
          the four Departments in the Ministry.
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>The Ministry And Its Departments</h3>
        <p>
          The principal task of the Ministry is to frame policy directions on
          defence and security related matters and communicate them for
          implementation to the Services Headquarters, Inter-Service
          Organisations, Production Establishments and Research & Development
          Organisations. It is required to ensure effective implementation of
          the Government's policy directions and the execution of approved
          programmes within the allocated resources. <br />
          The <strong>Department of Defence</strong> deals with the Integrated
          Defence Staff (IDS) and three Services and various Inter Service
          Organisations. It is also responsible for the Defence Budget,
          establishment matters, defence policy, matters relating to Parliament,
          defence co-operation with foreign countries and co-ordination of all
          defence related activities. <br />
          The <strong>Department of Defence Production</strong> is headed by a
          Secretary and deals with matters pertaining to defence production,
          indigenisation of imported stores, equipment and spares, planning and
          control of departmental production units of the Ordnance Factory Board
          and Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs). <br />
          The <strong>Department of Defence Research and Development</strong> is
          headed by a Secretary, who is the Scientific Adviser to the Raksha
          Mantri. Its function is to advise the Government on scientific aspects
          of military equipment and logistics and the formulation of research,
          design and development plans for equipment required by the Services.
          <br />
          The <strong>Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare</strong> is headed by
          a Secretary and deals with all resettlement, welfare and pensionary
          matters of Ex-Servicemen.
