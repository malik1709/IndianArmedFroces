        <h2>ETHOS</h2>
        <p>
          The infusion of high technology based precision weaponry has enhanced
          the lethality of future warfare manyfold. The spectrum of threat
          ranges from the nuclear to the conventional and the assymetric, with
          terrorism emerging like a hydra-headed monster. Add to this the
          rigours of climate i.e. the glacial heights and extreme cold, dense
          mountainous jungles and the heat and simoom of the deserts. Such are
          the trying environs in which a soldier operates. However, to a soldier
          facing such challenges and going beyond the call of duty is but second
          nature. Life's turbulences and turmoils have a special flavour for
          him. For those not exposed to a war or war like environment, this
          flavour is beyond the realms of imagination. The Indian Army soldier
          is infused by a set of values that make the soldier willingly face a
          plethora of challenges and difficulties, and when the call may come,
          to give the ultimate sacrifice in the service of the Nation. The ethos
          of the Army is ingrained in all soldiers with an unwavering will to
          succeed, accepting their grave responsibility and an unbridled ability
          to give their lives for others; confident that in return the nation
          will look after them and their families. The values of the army
          infused in the soldier through the years of training are enumerated
          below <br /><br />
          <strong>Espirit-de-Corps</strong> The spirit of comradeship and
          brotherhood of the brave, regardless of caste, creed or religion. The
          motto is, "One for all and all for one"! <br /><br />
          <strong>Spirit of Selfless Sacrifice</strong> The tradition is never
          to question, but to do or die for the three "Ns"; Naam, i.e.
          name-honour- of the unit/Army/Nation, 'Namak'(salt) i.e. loyalty to
          the Nation, and 'Nishan', i.e. the insignia or flag of his
          unit/regiment/Army/Nation which the soldiers hold afloat willingly.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Valour Fearlessness</strong> in combat and in the face of the
          enemy even when fighting against great odds or even when facing sure
          death. <br /><br />
          <strong>Non-discrimination</strong> The Indian Army does not
          discriminate on account of caste, creed or religion. A soldier is a
          soldier first and anything else later. He prays under a common roof.
          It is this unique character, which makes him bind in a team despite
          such diversity. <br /><br />
          <strong>Fairness and Honesty</strong> The spirit of honesty and fair
          play. He fights for a just cause that extends even to the enemy
          (prisoner or wounded). <br /><br />
          <strong>Discipline and Integrity</strong> Discipline and integrity
          impart the feeling of patriotism, honesty and courage under all
          circumstances, however strong be the provocation otherwise.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Fidelity, Honour and Courage</strong> He is a man on whose
          shoulders lies the honour and integrity of his nation. He knows that
          he is the last line of defence and he cannot fail the Nation.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Death to Dishonour</strong> A close bond amongst soldiers
          forces them to choose death to dishonour. The concept of 'IZZAT'
          (HONOUR) in the clan / unit enables them to shun the fear of death; to
          be called a coward in the peer group is worse than death. <br /><br />
          <strong>Forthrightness</strong> A soldier has to be forthright, for on
          his word the men he leads are going to lay down their lives without
          questioning why. <br /><br />
          These values stoke the attitude of Service before Self in every
          soldier. The famous credo of Chetwode Hall is deeply imbibed in the
          men in Olive Green. It is the spirit of this credo, imbibed in every
          officer that binds him with his men in an unshakeable bond of
          camaraderie.

          <strong
            >The safety, honour and welfare of your country comes first always
            and every time. <br /><br />

            The honour, welfare and comfort of the men you command come next.
            <br /><br />

            Your own ease, comfort and safety come last always and every
            time.</strong
