        <h2>GENESIS OF INDIAN NAVY</h2>
        <p>
          The history of the Indian Navy can be traced back to 1612 when Captain
          Best encountered and defeated the Portuguese. This encounter, as also
          the trouble caused by the pirates, forced the British East India
          Company to maintain a small fleet at Swally, near Surat(Gujarat). The
          First Squadron of fighting ships arrived on 5 September 1612, forming
          what was then called the Honourable East India Company's Marine. It
          was responsible for the protection of the East India Company's trade
          in the Gulf of Cambay and the river mouths of the Tapti and Narmada.
          The officers and the men of this force went on to play an important
          role in surveying the Arabian, Persian and Indian coastlines.<br /><br />
          Although Bombay had been ceded to the British in 1662, they physically
          took possession of the island on 8 February 1665, only to pass it on
          to the East India Company on 27 September 1668. As a consequence, the
          Honourable East India Company's Marine also became responsible for the
          protection of trade off Bombay.<br /><br />
          By 1686, with British commerce having shifted predominantly to Bombay,
          the name of this force was changed to Bombay Marine. This force
          rendered unique service, fighting not only the Portuguese, Dutch and
          French, but also interlopers and pirates of various nationalities. The
          Bombay Marine was involved in combat against the Marathas and the
          Sidis and participated in the Burma War in 1824.<br /><br />
          In 1830, the Bombay Marine was renamed Her Majesty's Indian Navy. With
          the capture of Aden by the British and the institution of the Indus
          Flotilla, the Navy's commitments grew manifold, and its deployment in
          the China War in 1840 bears adequate testimony to its proficiency.<br /><br />
          Whilst the Navy's strength continued to grow, it underwent numerous
          changes of nomenclature over the next few decades. It was renamed the
          Bombay Marine from 1863 to 1877, after which it became Her Majesty's
          Indian Marine. At this time, the Marine had two divisions, the Eastern
          Division based at Calcutta under the Superintendent, Bay of Bengal,
          and the Western Division at Bombay under the Superintendent, Arabian
          Sea. In recognition of the services rendered during various campaigns,
          its title was changed to Royal Indian Marine in 1892, by which time it
          consisted of over 50 vessels. The Royal Indian Marine went into action
          with a fleet of minesweepers, patrol vessels and troop carriers during
          the First World War when mines were detected off Bombay and Aden, and
          was utilised mainly for patrolling, ferrying troops and carrying war
          stores to Iraq, Egypt and East Africa.<br /><br />
          The first Indian to be granted a commission was Sub Lieutenant D.N
          Mukherji who joined the Royal Indian Marine as an engineer officer in
          1928. In 1934, the Royal Indian Marine was re-organised into the Royal
          Indian Navy, and was presented the King's Colour in 1935 in
          recognition of its services. At the outbreak of the Second World War,
          the Royal Indian Navy consisted of eight warships. By the end of the
          war, its strength had risen to 117 combat vessels and 30,000 personnel
          who had seen action in various theatres of operations.<br /><br />
          On India attaining Independence, the Royal Indian Navy consisted of 32
          ageing vessels suitable only for coastal patrol, along with 11,000
          officers and men. The senior officers were drawn from the Royal Navy,
          with R Adm ITS Hall, CIE, being the first Post-independence
          Commander-in-Chief. The prefix 'Royal' was dropped on 26 January 1950
          with India being constituted as a Republic. The first
          Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Navy was Adm Sir Edward Parry, KCB,
          who handed over to Adm Sir Mark Pizey, KBE, CB, DSO in 1951. Adm Pizey
          also became the first Chief of the Naval Staff in 1955, and was
          succeeded by V Adm SH Carlill, CB, DSO.<br /><br />
          On 22 April 1958 V Adm RD Katari assumed office as the first Indian
          Chief of the Naval Staff.

        <h3>Brief History of Navy Day</h3>
        <p>
          On 21 October 1944, the Royal Indian Navy celebrated Navy Day for the
          first time. The idea behind celebrating Navy Day was to foster greater
          outreach and increase awareness about the Navy among the public. This
          involved conducting parades at various port cities, as well as holding
          public meetings at inland centres. This was met with considerable
          success and aroused great enthusiasm among the public.<br /><br />
          Seeing its success, it was decided to organise similar functions every
          year on a larger scale and later in the season when the weather was
          cooler. Accordingly, Navy Day 1945 was celebrated at Bombay and
          Karachi on 01 December.<br /><br />
          In due course and until 1972, Navy Day came to be celebrated on 15
          December and the week in which 15 December fell was observed as the
          Navy Week.<br /><br />
          At the Senior Naval Officers Conference in May 1972, it was decided
          that Navy Day would be celebrated on 04 December to commemorate the
          very successful naval actions in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal
          during the Indo Pakistan War and Navy Week would be observed from 01
          to 07 December.
