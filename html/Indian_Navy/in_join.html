        <h3>As an Officer</h3>
        <p>
          Recruitment as an Officer in the Navy is based on 'All India Merit'

          <strong>1. UPSC ENTRIES</strong><br /><br />
          The UPSC holds an examination for the entry into the National Defence
          Academy (NDA)/Naval Academy (10+2) and Combined Defence Services
          Examination (CDSE), twice a year. The UPSC entries are Permanent
          Commission (PC) entries in which the UPSC calls for applications,
          conducts the written examination and short lists candidates for SSB.
          Short listed candidates are sent to the SSBs located at Bangalore,
          Bhopal and Coimbatore. Result of qualified candidates is forwarded to
          UPSC for making the final merit. Medically fit candidates who are in
