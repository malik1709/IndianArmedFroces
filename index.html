        The Indian Armed Forces are the military forces of the Republic of
        India. It consists of three professional uniformed services: the Indian
        Army, Indian Navy, and Indian Air Force. Additionally, the Indian Armed
        Forces are supported by the Indian Coast Guard and paramilitary
        organisations (Assam Rifles, and Special Frontier Force) and various
        inter-service commands and institutions such as the Strategic Forces
        Command, the Andaman and Nicobar Command and the Integrated Defence
        Staff. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian
        Armed Forces. The Indian Armed Forces are under the management of the
        Ministry of Defence (MoD) of the Government of India. With strength of
        over 1.4 million active personnel, it is the world's second-largest
        military force and has the world's largest volunteer army. It also has
        the third-largest defence budget in the world. As per 2015 Credit Suisse
        report, the Indian Armed Forces is the world's fifth-most powerful
        military, whereas the 2020 GlobalFirepower report lists it as the fourth
        most-powerful military.<br /><br />
        It is important to note that the Central Armed Police Forces, which are
        referred to as 'Paramilitary Forces' are not armed forces. As such they
        are headed by civilian officers from the Indian Police Service and are
        under the control of the Ministry of Home Affairs, not the Ministry of
        Defence. These are central police organisations. The Indian armed forces
        have been engaged in a number of major military operations, including:
        the Indo-Pakistani wars of 1947, 1965 and 1971, the Portuguese-Indian
        War, the Sino-Indian War, the 1967 Chola incident, the 1987 Sino-Indian
        skirmish, the Kargil War, and the Siachen conflict among others. India
        honours its armed forces and military personnel annually on Armed Forces
        Flag Day, 7 December. Since 1962, the IAF has maintained close military
        relations with Russia, including cooperative development of programmes
        such as the Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) and the Multirole
        Transport Aircraft (MTA). Armed with the nuclear triad, the Indian armed
        forces are steadily undergoing modernisation,with investments in areas
        such as futuristic soldier systems and missile defence systems.<br /><br />
        The Department of Defence Production of the Ministry of Defence is
        responsible for the indigenous production of equipment used by the
        Indian Armed Forces. It comprises the 41 Indian Ordnance Factories under
        the control of the Ordnance Factories Board, and eight Defence PSUs
        namely: HAL, BEL, BEML, BDL, MDL, GSL, GRSE and Midhani. India remains
        one of the largest importer of defence equipment with Russia, Israel,
        France and the United States being the top foreign suppliers of military
        equipment. The Government of India has launched a Make in India
        initiative to indigenise manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports,
        including defence imports and procurement.

        <summary>Overview</summary>
        <p>
          The headquarters of the Indian Armed Forces is in New Delhi, the
          capital city of India. The President of India serves as the formal
          Supreme Commander of the Indian Armed Forces, while actual control
          lies with the executive headed by the Prime Minister of India. The
          Ministry of Defence (MoD) is the ministry charged with the
          responsibilities of countering insurgency and ensuring external
          security of India. General Manoj Mukund Naravane is the Chief of the
          Army Staff (COAS), Admiral Karambir Singh is the Chief of the Naval
          Staff (CNS) and Air Chief Marshal Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria is the
          Chief of the Air Staff (CAS).<br /><br />

          The Indian armed force are split into different groups based on their
          region of operation. The Indian Army is divided administratively into
          seven tactical commands, each under the control of different
          Lieutenant Generals. The Indian Air Force is divided into five
          operational and two functional commands.[58] Each command is headed by
          an air officer commanding-in-chief with the rank of air marshal. The
          Indian Navy operates three commands. Each command is headed by a flag
          officer commanding-in-chief with the rank of vice admiral. There are
          two joint commands whose head can belong to any of the three services.
          These are the Strategic Forces Command and the Andaman and Nicobar
          Command. The lack of an overall military commander has helped keep the
          Indian Armed Forces under civilian control, and has prevented the rise
          of military dictatorships unlike in neighbouring Pakistan.<br /><br />

          South Block in New Delhi is the headquarters of the Ministry of
          Defence. The Armed Forces have four main tasks-<br /><br />

          1. To assert the territorial integrity of India.<br /><br />2. To
          defend the country if attacked by a foreign nation.<br /><br />3. To
          support the civil community in case of disasters (e.g. flooding).<br /><br />4.
          To participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations in consonance
          with India's commitment to the United Nations Charter.<br /><br />
          The code of conduct of the Indian military is detailed in a
          semi-official book called Customs and Etiquette in the Services,
          written by retired Major General Ravi Arora, which details how Indian
          personnel are expected to conduct themselves generally. Arora is an
          executive editor of the Indian Military Review.<br /><br />

          The major deployments of the Indian army constitute the border regions
          of India, particularly Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, and Northeast India,
          to engage in counter-insurgency and anti-terrorist operations. The
          major commitments of the Indian Navy constitute patrol missions,
          anti-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia, the 'Singapore Indian
          Maritime Bilateral Exercise' with the Republic of Singapore Navy in
          the Straits of Malacca, maintaining a military presence in Southeast
          Asias waters, and joint exercises with other countries, such as:
          Brasil, South Africa, the United States and Japan, France (Varuna
          naval exercises), the People's Republic of China, the Russian Navy
          (INDRA naval exercises), and others.<br /><br />

          Top ten military expenditures in US$ Bn. in 2014, according to the
          International Institute for Strategic Studies.<br /><br />
          Between April 2015 and March 2016, India allocated $40 billion to
          Defence Services, $10 billion to Defence (Civil Estimates) and another
          $10 billion to the Home Ministry for Paramilitary and CAPF forces – a
          total allocation for defence and security of about $60 billion for the
          financial year 2015–16. In 2016–17, the contribution to the Home
          Ministry has been increased from $10 billion to $11.5 billion.<br /><br />

          Contemporary criticism of the Indian military have drawn attention to
          several issues, such as lack of political reform, obsolete equipment,
          lack of adequate ammunition, and inadequate research and development
          due to over-reliance on foreign imports. In addition, the lack of a
          'strategic culture' among the political class in India is claimed to
          have hindered the effectiveness of the Indian military. Critics
          believe these issues hobble the progress and modernisation of the
          military. However, analysis by the Central Intelligence Agency
          indicates that India is projected to have the fourth most capable
          concentration of power by 2015.According to a report published by the
          US Congress, India is the developing world's leading arms purchaser.
          It is investing ₹99.7 billion (US$1.4 billion) to build a dedicated
          and secure optical fibre cable (OFC) network for exclusive use of the
          Army, Navy and Air Force. This will be one of the world's largest
          closed user group (CUG) networks.
